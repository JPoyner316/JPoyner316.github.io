      <h1>Data Analysis Project for CS 1030</h1>
      <h2>By Jackson D. Poyner</h2>
      <p>This is my final project for CS 1030 on data analysis. In this project I went through the course on Khan Academy on data analysis and used that knowledge to interpret data found on <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data">DATA.gov</a>.</p>
      <h2>Learning Section</h2>
      <p>In this section I will give a summary of my learning path as I traverse the Khan Academy course on data analysis</p>
      <h3>Data tools</h3>
      <p>There are many different ways that we can store data. The three examples given are text files, CSV files, and Spreadsheets. They all have advantages and disadvantages such as CSV files which are limited to computer space and generally need to be used in a spreadsheet to be viewed comfortably. I was also shown many of the commands that could be used to gather data and different pieces of information about data, this was done in SQL and in google sheets. Then I got to learn about google trends which allows me to plot my data and see if my data follows an upward or downward trend. I also reviewed some ways to make predictions based on data which I've been doing all semester in my probability and statistics class. Finally, I learned how to form hypotheses and make conclusions based on the given data.</p>
      <h3>Big Data</h3>
      <p>This section starts by describing how in this day and age it is impossible to avoid giving our data to companies because in everything we do someone is collecting data on it from our internet use to our bills. Next, I explored the different ways that we collect big data from the Hadron Collider to satellites floating around the earth, and how from this data we can collect hundreds of thousands of pieces of data. The section then moves to how medical records can be stored and used to help doctors give accurate diagnoses faster, and how social media sites can collect large amounts of data for analytics and advertising information. Some of the major challenges with big data are storage and the time spent processing big data. For instance, a website like twitter needs big servers to store every tweet, search, account, and like, and it needs to be able to do this efficiently. As a result, they end up using large fast servers that are very expensive to upkeep. There's also an issue with responsibility when it comes to using massive amounts of data such as credit card companies that are storing mass amounts of financial information. </p>
      <h3>Bias in Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>This section begins by defining machine learning as an algorithm that automatically improves itself based on experience. It goes on to focus on three forms of machine learning, reinforcement learning (navigational programs), unsupervised learning (recommendation systems), and supervised learning (prediction algorithms). I learned a lot about neural networks and how I as a programmer can train neural networks using images and weights. These systems' accuracy is determined by their training, so it is important that the program gets high quality training for better accuracy. This section moves on to bias in programs citing criminal justice and career-based algorithms which have been found to be biased against different races and ethnic groups. This section continues in bias by talking about facial recognition being biased towards white people and how there have been movements to get rid of facial recognition. The section ends with language bias which describes the nuance of context in language which makes it difficult for programs to make assumptions on different languages.</p>
      <h3>Unit Test</h3>
      <p>I didn’t find the unit test to be very helpful. This is because there is already a form of exam at the end of each section which allows you to test and solidify your knowledge of a topic. This makes the unit test feel like busy work and makes less of an impact on my learning. A better way to do this would be to save all the questions for the end of the section and then when a question is answered wrong, tell the person where they can find the correct answer. Another issue with putting testing in the middle of learning is that the questions are basically copied and pasted into the unit test which means I’m not being taught anymore by taking the unit test.</p>
      <h2>Data Analysis Section</h2>
      <p>In this section I'll be analyzing the collected data to answer a question.</p>
      <h3>Data Selection</h3>
      <p>As stated earlier I selected <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data">DATA.gov</a> as the website where I would collect my data values.</p>
      <p>From this website I found a data set on the electric vehicle population in Washington. <a href="https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2/about_data">Here</a> is the landing page which contains the downloaded data and notes on the data.</p>
      <h3>What am I asking?</h3>
      <p>The question I will be asking for this data analysis is <strong>which county of Washington has the most Teslas?</strong></p>
      <p>For the data analysis I used Excels COUNTIFS Function to compare counties to Teslas. There were 194 different counties to chose but because 155 countys have less than 10 Teslas we will only include the top 20 counties in the bar graph <b>below</b>.</p>
